          Findings and Recommendations
          ----------------------------

Finding 1: PL/SQL Execution

      for addition information.
   Rationale
      The SQL statement executed in container PDBORADLT with database ID
      1427182925.
   Rationale
      Subprogam ID 30 of PL/SQL ID 11620 spent 186 seconds in execution.


Finding 2: Top SQL Statements
Impact is .08 active sessions, 48.39% of total activity.
--------------------------------------------------------
SQL statements consuming significant database time were found. These
statements offer a good opportunity for performance improvement.

   Recommendation 1: SQL Tuning
   Estimated benefit is .08 active sessions, 48.39% of total activity.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the PL/SQL statement with SQL_ID "gf3s1cyuwtx2h" for
      possible performance improvements. You can supplement the information
      given here with an ASH report for this SQL_ID.
      Related Object
         SQL statement with SQL_ID gf3s1cyuwtx2h.
         begin
         :batch_id := dlt_sys$migrateobj.migrateOwner(pSourceOwner =>
         'dba_dlt',
         pMigrateMode => dlt_sys$migrateobj.M_ONLY_SCRIPT,
         pDataTables  => null);
         end;
   Rationale
      The SQL statement executed in container PDBORADLT with database ID
      1427182925.
   Rationale
      The SQL Tuning Advisor cannot operate on PL/SQL statements.
   Rationale
      Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 0% for SQL execution,
      0% for parsing, 100% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java execution.
   Rationale
      SQL statement with SQL_ID "gf3s1cyuwtx2h" was executed 1 times and had
      an average elapsed time of 249 seconds.

Impact is .05 active sessions, 27.04% of total activity.
--------------------------------------------------------
Hard parsing of SQL statements was consuming significant database time.
Hard parsing SQL statements that encountered parse errors was not consuming
significant database time.
Hard parses due to literal usage and cursor invalidation were not consuming
significant database time.
The Oracle instance memory (SGA and PGA) was adequately sized.

   No recommendations are available.


Finding 4: "User I/O" wait Class
Impact is .04 active sessions, 22.35% of total activity.
--------------------------------------------------------
Wait class "User I/O" was consuming significant database time.
The Oracle instance memory (SGA and PGA) was adequately sized.

   No recommendations are available.


Finding 5: Undo I/O
Impact is .04 active sessions, 22.13% of total activity.
--------------------------------------------------------
Undo I/O was a significant portion (99%) of the total database I/O.

   No recommendations are available.

   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      The throughput of the I/O subsystem was significantly lower than
      expected.
      Impact is 0 active sessions, 1.74% of total activity.
         Wait class "User I/O" was consuming significant database time.
         Impact is .04 active sessions, 22.35% of total activity.


Finding 6: Shared Pool Latches
Impact is .01 active sessions, 3.91% of total activity.
-------------------------------------------------------
Contention for latches related to the shared pool was consuming significant
database time.
Waits for "library cache load lock" amounted to 2% of database time.
Waits for "cursor: pin S wait on X" amounted to 1% of database time.

   No recommendations are available.

   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      Wait class "Concurrency" was consuming significant database time.
      Impact is .01 active sessions, 3.91% of total activity.


Finding 7: PL/SQL Compilation
Impact is .01 active sessions, 3.83% of total activity.
-------------------------------------------------------
PL/SQL compilation consumed significant database time.

   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .01 active sessions, 3.83% of total activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Investigate the appropriateness of PL/SQL compilation. PL/SQL
      compilation can be caused by DDL on dependent objects.


Finding 8: Hard Parse Due to Sharing Criteria
Impact is .01 active sessions, 3.41% of total activity.
-------------------------------------------------------
SQL statements with the same text were not shared because of cursor
environment mismatch. This resulted in additional hard parses which were
consuming significant database time.
Common causes of environment mismatch are session NLS settings, SQL trace
settings and optimizer parameters.

   Recommendation 1: Application Analysis
   Estimated benefit is .01 active sessions, 3.41% of total activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Look for top reason for cursor environment mismatch in
      V$SQL_SHARED_CURSOR.

   Symptoms That Led to the Finding:
   ---------------------------------
      Hard parsing of SQL statements was consuming significant database time.
      Impact is .05 active sessions, 27.04% of total activity.


Finding 9: I/O Throughput
Impact is 0 active sessions, 1.74% of total activity.
-----------------------------------------------------
The throughput of the I/O subsystem was significantly lower than expected.

   Recommendation 1: Host Configuration
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 1.74% of total activity.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      Consider increasing the throughput of the I/O subsystem. Oracle's
      recommended solution is to stripe all data files using the SAME
      methodology. You might also need to increase the number of disks for
      better performance.
   Rationale
      During the analysis period, the average data files' I/O throughput was
      256 K per second for reads and 370 K per second for writes. The average
      response time for single block reads was 44 milliseconds.

   Recommendation 2: Host Configuration
   Estimated benefit is 0 active sessions, 1.74% of total activity.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Action
      The performance of some data and temp files was significantly worse than
      others. If striping all files using the SAME methodology is not
      possible, consider striping these file over multiple disks.
   Rationale
      For file D:\APP\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORADLT\UNDOTBS01.DBF in the root
      container, the average response time for single block reads was 290
      milliseconds and the total excess I/O wait was 66 seconds.
